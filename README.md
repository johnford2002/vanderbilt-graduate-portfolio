As part of Vanderbilt’s CS-8395 Quantum Computing, in addition to developing a deeper understanding of quantum computing, I also wanted to get a sense of the landscape of providers for cloud quantum computing. As an IT professional, I’m often asked to survey new software and technology offerings. This project  presented a concise summary of my findings in an easy-to-read article format complete with references.

## **CONDUCT INDEPENDENT INQUIRY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE**
### Artifact - Conduct Independent Inquiry

As the final project for Vanderbilt’s CS-8395 Digital Forensics, I chose to explore capabilities for conducting forensics investigations within a kubernetes cluster. While my academic and professional projects have often involved interacting with kubernetes, I have had little opportunity to work on the initialization, maintenance, and security aspects of a cluster. This project was a perfect alignment of goals, learn more about kubernetes and understand how forensics tooling adapts to new developments in distributed computing environments.
